# Todo-App using Next.js and Tailwind CSS

A simple todo-app using localStorage for all todos.
The theme can be changed between light and dark mode.

Todos can be created, completed and deleted, as well as reorganized using drag and drop.

You can filter by either active or completed task and if so desired remove all completed with one button press.

This was a challenge by Frontend Mentor
I chose TailwindCSS, because it's my favorite way of building the Frontend.

Next.js was chosen, because I want to learn more about it.
